intro: |
  Recent advances in data geoscience see us communicating information now in code. This new and unique form of communication requires us to understand both science method and code. I have created this page with the aim to share with others the wonderful work being done in this field and the huge impact this is having on geological work around the world.
  
  I hope this blog helps you to better understand the geological data science in an interactive way. A place to enjoy, a place to learn more.
